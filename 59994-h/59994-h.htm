<p>They ran around the wood, here and there
and everywhere, eating roots and twigs and
any old scraps they could find. But still
they were HUNGRY.</p>

<p>One day they came to a Big Tree full of
fruit. But they could not eat it, for they did
not know what it was.</p>

<p>They sat down in a circle round the tree,
and said, &#8220;What can we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had thought a while, they said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
&#8220;Let us send Robin Rat up the river to Leo,
our King, and ask him what the fruit is and
whether we may eat it.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_008.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">ROBIN RAT PICKS THE FRUIT</p>

<p>Robin Rat was young and spry. He scuttled
up the tree and brought down one of its
fruits to show King Leo.</p>

<p>It was a DELICIOUS looking fruit!</p>

<p>It looked like an</p>

<p class="center">APPLEORANGEPLUMPEARBANANA</p>

<p>but it smelled like a</p>

ready to receive visitors. He was wearing
his crown tipped on the back of his head
because he felt happy. He smiled at Robin
Rat as pleasant as you please, and asked him
to stay to supper.</p>

<p>All the Beasts were waiting for him on

just to show how well he could do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Robin Rat?&#8221; said All the
Beasts. &#8220;Tell us the name!&#8221; they roared
and howled and grunted and whined and
shrieked and squealed, each in his own PARTICULAR

<p>He smiled politely but he did not invite

rowed&mdash;and he ro-o-owed until the oars&mdash;dropped&mdash;from&mdash;his&mdash;hands&mdash;and
the big river took the boat down itself.</p>

<p>Pinky Pig curled up under the seat. And

<p>In the morning Pinky Pig sat up and
rubbed his eyes. He was at home. All the
Beasts stood on the river bank looking at
him. &#8220;What is it, Pinky Pig? Tell us the
name!&#8221; they whistled and snarled and
squealed and shrieked and whined and grunted
and howled and roared, each in his own PARTICULAR

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Pinky Pig. Then he

<p>But now All the Beasts were HUNGRIER

nails if there had been any nails in the Great
Wood.</p>

<p>They sat in a circle round the tree and
thought a while.</p>



<p>Then they said,
&#8220;Giddy Goat is
older than Pinky
Pig, and wiser
than Robin Rat.
Let us send him
to King
Leo to ask
the name

afraid of catching cold. Away he ran&mdash;ker-lipp,
ker-lipp&mdash;to his house to get a big
woolly muffler to wear on the river. He
wrapped it three times round his neck and
tucked it neatly under his beard.</p>

<p>Then he ran&mdash;ker-lipp, ker-lipp&mdash;down to
his little sailboat on the river.</p>

<p>All the night and all the night he sailed<br />
<span class="gap">and he sailed</span><br />
<span class="gap3">and he SAILED.</span></p>

<p>All the way he was remembering the name,
and he remembered it very well.</p>

<p>He sailed so fast that he got home in the
early, early morning.</p>

<p>And all the way when he wasn&#8217;t remembering
the name, he was sneezing:</p>

<p>&#8220;A-tchoo! A-rashum! A-tchoo!&#8221;</p>

<p>All the Beasts were waiting for him&mdash;rows
and rows of them. Those in the back rows
looked over the shoulders of those in the front
rows, or climbed on their backs.</p>



<p>They pushed and jostled one another until
they had upset Giddy Goat&#8217;s sailboat. Ker-splash!&mdash;he
went into the river.</p>



<p>Such a sight as he was when they pulled
him out. His long hair was full of water.
His beard was full of water. His eyes were
full of water. His beautiful new muffler was
full of water.</p>

<p>When the animals crowded round him to
ask the name of the tree, he shook himself so
that the water flew in their faces, and ran
away home&mdash;ker-lipp,
ker-lipp&mdash;with
a most

TOMMY TORTOISE</h2></div>


<p>By this time All the Beasts were so <span class="gesperrt">HUNGRY</span>
that they sat round the tree and cried.</p>

<p>You see there was no one else who had a
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; they wailed and
howled and buzzed and grunted and groaned
and sobbed and lamented, each in his own
most PARTICULAR voice.</p>

<p>Then Tommy Tortoise, who had been lying
asleep in the sun, opened one eye, and said,
&#8220;What is all this fuss about? Haven&#8217;t you
found out the name of this tree YET?&#8221;</p>

<p>They said they had not and cried harder
than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if that&#8217;s all, I&#8217;ll go
and get it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;YOU!&#8221; snarled Tabby Tiger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You! You!&#8221; grunted Bruno Bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; snapped Katy Crocodile, biting her
word off short.</p>

<p>&#8220;You-u-u-u!&#8221; trumpeted Elizabeth Elephant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You! You! You!&#8221; chattered Mimi Monkey.</p>

<p>You never heard such a noise&mdash;not even at
the circus&mdash;as there was when they all said
this, each in his own PARTICULAR voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, me&mdash;I mean <i>I</i>,&#8221; said Tommy Tortoise
in his little, thin voice.</p>

<p>Then he crawled slowly home, trailing one
foot after the other, as some boys do on their
way to school.</p>

<p>He found his mother knitting stockings and
rocking the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hssh!&#8221; said Mrs. Tortoise. &#8220;He&#8217;s just
dropping off.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Tommy Tortoise. &#8220;How
can I remember the name of that tree if I go
up the river to get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tommy,&#8221; said Mrs. Tortoise, &#8220;do you remember
how you used to go to school with all
the other little tortoises and learn things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tommy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#8220;Nine times one makes nine,<br />
Nine times two makes eighteen,<br />
Nine times three makes twenty-seven&mdash;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He said the Nines table because anybody can
say the Tens, and he wasn&#8217;t sure about the
Elevens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hsh!&#8221; said Mrs. Tortoise. &#8220;That will do.
You will wake the Baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will tell you how to remember.&#8221;
She whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>Then she said, &#8220;Now, Tommy, whatever
happens to you, mind your manners. Remember
to bow to King Leo and to speak to
him so politely that he will know you have
been well brought up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother,&#8221; said Tommy Tortoise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">MRS. TORTOISE GIVES ADVICE</p>

<p>Then he put on his cap with the red tassel,
and he went down to the river. He had no
boat; so he had to swim.</p>

<p>
All the day and all the day he swam<br />
<span class="gap">and he swam</span><br />
<span class="gap3">and he SWAM.</span></p>

<p>When he was tired swimming, he would turn
over on his shell and float with all his legs
kicking in the water, just as the Baby kicks
in his bath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>And the Great Red Sun dropped behind the
trees.</p>

<p>When Tommy Tortoise reached King Leo&#8217;s
home, King Leo was NOT curled up comfortably
wearing his crown and ready to receive
visitors. He was standing on the river bank
waving his tail. His big head was waggling
<i>this</i> way and <i>that</i> way, and he was not smiling
AT ALL.</p>

<p>Before Tommy could speak a word, or even
make his best bow, King Leo said:</p>

<p>&#8220;R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!
S-s-cat! S-scamper! S-scat! S-skedaddle!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I told Robin Rat.<br />
I told Pinky Pig.<br />
I told Giddy Goat.<br />
I WILL NOT TELL YOU</p></blockquote>

<p>that the name of the tree is bojabi.</p>

<p>R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bojabi,&#8221; whispers Tommy Tortoise to
himself, and jumps&mdash;ker-lump&mdash;into the river
again.</p>

<span class="gap">and he swam</span><br />
<span class="gap3">and he SWAM.</span></p>

<p>But it was easy work to let the big river carry
him on its back.</p>

<p>All the night and all the night he made up
a little song and sang it, like this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">

<p>All the Beasts were lying on the bank of
the river. Far away they heard the little,
thin voice of Tommy Tortoise singing his
song. They pricked up their ears, looking
<i>this</i> way and <i>that</i> way as they listened.</p>

<p>And presently Tommy Tortoise came crawling
up through the mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they cried, each in his own
PARTICULAR voice. You would have
thought that all the circuses in the world were
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bojabi,&#8221; said Tommy Tortoise, and

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
